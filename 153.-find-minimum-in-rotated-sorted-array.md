# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### 題目

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

* **方法一**

```
var findMin = function(nums) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = nums.length - 1;
    let minIndex = 0;
    
    while(low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if(nums[mid] < nums[minIndex]) minIndex = mid;
        if(nums[mid] >= nums[0]) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    // nums[0] -> 沒有 rotate 的狀況 ex. [1,2,3,4,5]
    // nums[minIndex] -> 有 rotate 的狀況 ex. [3,4,5,1,2]
    return Math.min(nums[0], nums[minIndex]);
};
```

```
let nums = [3,4,5,1,2]; // 1
// nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]; // 0
// nums = [11,13,15,17]; // 11
// nums = [2,1]; // 1

console.log(findMin(nums))
```
