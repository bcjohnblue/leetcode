# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

### 題目

Write a function to **delete a node** in a singly-linked list. You will **not** be given access to the `head` of the list, instead you will be given access to **the node to be deleted** directly.

It is **guaranteed** that the node to be deleted is **not a tail node** in the list.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
