# 13. Roman to Integer

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

### 題目

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.&#x20;
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.&#x20;
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

* **方法一**

```
var romanToInt = function(s) {
    let res = 0;
    const mapRomanToInt = {
        I: 1,
        V: 5,
        X: 10,
        L: 50,
        C: 100,
        D: 500,
        M: 1000
    }
    for(let i=0; i<s.length; i++) {
        const value = s[i];
        const next = s[i+1];
        
        if (next === 'V' && value === 'I') {
            res += 4
            i++;
        } else if (next === 'X' && value === 'I') {
            res += 9;
            i++;
        } else if (next === 'L' && value === 'X') {
            res += 40;
            i++;
        } else if (next === 'C' && value === 'X') {
            res += 90;
            i++;
        } else if (next === 'D' && value === 'C') {
            res += 400;
            i++;
        } else if (next === 'M' && value === 'C') {
            res += 900;
            i++;
        } else {
            res += mapRomanToInt[value]
        }
    }
    return res;
};
