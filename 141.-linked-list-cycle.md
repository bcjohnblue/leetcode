# 141. Linked List Cycle

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

### 題目

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

* **方法一**

利用 hashmap 儲存遍歷過的 node

```
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    const hashmap = new Map();
    
    let pointer = head;
    while(pointer) {
        if(hashmap.has(pointer.next)) return true;
        hashmap.set(pointer, true);
        pointer = pointer.next;
    }
    return false;
};
```

```
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    if(!head) return false;
    
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head.next;
    while(slow !== fast) {
        if(fast === null || fast.next === null) return false;
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    return true;
};
