# 162. Find Peak Element

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

### 題目

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

* **方法一**

```
var findPeakElement = function(nums) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = nums.length - 1;
    nums[-1] = nums[nums.length] = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
    
    while(start<=end) {
        const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        
        if(nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1])return mid;
        if(nums[mid] > nums[mid-1]) start = mid + 1;
        else end = mid;
    }
};
```
