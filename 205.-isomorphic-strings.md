# 205. Isomorphic Strings

### Leetcode

[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

### 題目

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

* **方法一**

```
var isIsomorphic = function(s, t) {
    const map1 = {};
    const map2 = {};
    for(let i=0; i<s.length; i++) {
        if(map1[s[i]] || map2[t[i]]) {
            if(map1[s[i]] !== t[i]) return false;
            if(map2[t[i]] !== s[i]) return false;
        } else {
            map1[s[i]] = t[i];
            map2[t[i]] = s[i];
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```
